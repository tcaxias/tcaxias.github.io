<p>My name is Tiago Caxias. I am a computer scientist and I daily dwell in
product engineering.</p>
<p>I am passionate about computer science, programming languages, distributed

between UX, product delivery and everything written in the previous sentence.</p>
<p>In here you will find some texts written in

<p>There is a evaluation cycle going on right now, at my present company,
that requires people to write a self-reflection and send it to their manager.
While I firmly disagree with self-appraisals, don't trust the fallacy that you
can evaluate yourself, doing a self-reflection is both important and fruitful.
It's a good way to measure how your behavior and perception have evolved over
time since every self-reflection is a function on these two variables.
I'm moving on to a new challenge on another company so I decided to make
this self-reflection public, this is a good exercise mainly because it forces
me to bring all context when writing any topic, plus the text might be of
relative use to some readers.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#preamble" id="preamble">Preamble</a></h2>
<p>I finished a three year cycle, mostly as a principal engineer.
I met outstanding people, joined teams, grew teams, was mentor and mentee,
shared a lot of experiences and, in the end, I got this feeling that I was
naive when I joined.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's actually pretty good, it's a nice way
to measure how much I grew.
At the hiring process I was sold a vision of company which was in need of
strong technical expertise and joined with that in mind, strong tech
expertise was what I wanted to bring to this job when I joined and what I
expected to deliver.</p>
<p>Turns out creating products. technical expertise and delivering <strong>value</strong> are
quite different things.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#value" id="value">Value</a></h2>
<p>In a past life I worked a year and a half in a very small company, one of
those <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_business">lifestyle
companies</a></em>, and due to
its small size I got the opportunity of getting really close to processes
such as hiring, sales, customer service and defining company strategy.
These topics are of utmost importance to the majority of companies even
though they frequently are far from the software engineer.</p>
<p>This job was immensely useful since it made me understand very closely how
to run a company, how does the money come in, what's customer churn,
what's employee churn, what are prospects, what's upsell, what's the impact
of a good and a bad hire and, foremost, what's communication.
All of these things simply translate to value.</p>
<p>Value is what an employee can offer an employer, it's also what the employer
is supposed to give to the employee at the end of the month, value.
Salary, bonuses, benefits and any other perks are things that an employee
can get as part of their work, whether these translate to value depends on
the employee.
You may value something in your compensation package but one teammate
might value something else, which is normal.</p>
<p>You probably heard the sentence any decent answer to an interesting question
begins, <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/596007846887628801">&quot;it 
depends...&quot;</a>.
While this prerogative should not be abused, it surfaces the need to
understand context when providing answers, it's not easy to align
everyone's view in the same direction.
Reason being, different entities, people or companies, value things
differently.
As a corolary one may say value depends on need and perception,
how does one perceive value and which needs does one have.</p>
<p>I honestly find this concept extremely easy to understand, my employer is
supposed to give me value, things that I need and care about.
This begs the question, what am I supposed to give back to my employer?
The answer is pretty straightforward, employers want value; but not for
them, they want the employee to produce value for their customers.
This simplifies everything a lot, an employee should not worry about
the employer, they should worry about delivering value to the customers,
not the company customers, everyone's customers.</p>
<p>I still get puzzled by the immense literature about this topic.
First there the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">agile manifesto</a>
telling people to please their customers, then there's a multitude of <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/search/?searchTerm=lean&amp;ageRangesTotal=9537&amp;category=1897">lean
publications</a>
which, along with
<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/search/?searchTerm=agile&amp;ageRangesTotal=17&amp;category=1897">agile</a>,
got into the hype train.
If you read the agile manifesto and lean principles it tells you to deliver
value.
There's an entire new religion with fancy keywords and certifications,
popping up in résumées everywhere, to bring software engineers the word from
the messiah, and the word is, &quot;deliver value&quot;.</p>
<p>Apparently is hard to <strong>align</strong> everyone with this mindset.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#alignment" id="alignment">Alignment</a></h2>
<p>In the world of large companies people grew and became dedicated,
specialized, tech-savvy, used to their surroundings.
In these large companies, while leadership was aware of what they wanted the
company to deliver to customers, value, it became harder for the ones
producing this value to see the exact same picture.
It's fantastic that <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">some people</a>
focused on surfacing to the software engineering world that there are some
things being forgotten or neglected and one major sign is lack of alignment.</p>
<p>In fact this is not new, patterns have been studied for some time now which help us understand the behavior of groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_dynamics#Intragroup_dynamics">Ingroup
Dynamics</a>
as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_dynamics#Intergroup_dynamics">Intergroup
Dynamics</a>
are topics in which one can
dwell and better understand how large organizations act in fact as groups of groups.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_dynamics#Types_of_groups">Types of
Groups</a>
show a little bit of how humans have clear group priorities,
another item to add to the context that any person carries.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_states_theory">Status and
Expectations</a>
also provide vital roles in shaping groups and
ingroup behaviors, this bears the notion that humans have state, we are
state machines.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exchange_theory">Investing and expecting
return</a> from relations
is a topic easy to understand.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's number</a>
discusses a bit the size of the connection sphere a person can keep.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">Groupthink</a> shows that the
spheres pertain specific behaviors such as:
<ul>
<li>Asch's conformity experiment show that we act differently when in groups</li>
<li>Milgram experiment surfaces how one can choose authority over conscience
sometimes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I never studied sociology or group psychology but behavioral patterns in
companies are recurrent and seldom change.
Nothing is new here, mostly everyone knows empirically that there is a
majorant to the group size of people we can sustain stable relations with
(Dunbar), that when in groups people act differently (groupthink),
that we tend to expect return from investment (social exchange),
that the way we perceive someone makes us expect things from that person
(expectation states) and that everyone has a background and we value our
previous learnings and context (types of groups).</p>
<p>In these cases alignment comes down to communicating in a way that is
effective and overcomes the hurdles posed by the intergroup and ingroup
dynamics.
Communicating the best possible message, providing context, eliminating the
possibility of cognitive biases.
Keep in mind that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">not invented
here</a> is a simple
form of tribalism,
naturally bound to happen considering the patterns mentioned above.</p>
<p>Alignment is hard to keep in large organizations, which in fact are just a
group of <strong>groups</strong>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#groups" id="groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p>Why do we need agile coaches, then? We wouldn't need them if we could keep
focusing on something else outside our sphere of concern but since Dunbar
said that sphere has a bounded size, we're getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias#Types">cognitive
biases</a> on most
of our work.
There is a limited amount of things we can constantly think about plus we
favor our group over other people or groups.</p>
<p>Going back in time we can see solutions to this problem, how to keep groups
aligned, one such solution was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule">divide and
rule</a>.
While devious in purpose, this technique used an outstanding way of solving
the alignment problem, it moved the problem to smaller spheres, in
manageable group sizes alignment is easier to maintain.
Solving a problem is a goal clear enough and the ruler or any sphere had
the autonomy to achieve the goal as they would believe it was best.</p>
<p>With a large mediatic footprint, spotify did 
<a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/">two</a>
<a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/">parts</a>
on how they planned or achieved to address this.
There's a lot of controversy on whether spotify actually does this and
whether these models do work, that is not relevant, the bottom line is that
in order to achieve a major goal at scale, split that into smaller
independent goals and give them to smaller independent groups.
When the group size is manageable by all the sociology and group psychology
limitations alive today the group will have no alignment issues.
With a common goal we can even make use of group dynamics and make it
perform and deliver much better than in any other format.</p>
<p>The major caveat in the plan skethed above is that you cannot run a command-and-control structure. If you do, you'd be sharing expectations of things to happen instead of goals. The difference, if looking subtle, is a game changer.
<a href="https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/">Product teams vs feature
teams</a> is something I've
seldom seen properly applied.
I cannot stress enough how this must be done right and the vision of
product teams must be implemented without shortcuts, alternatives result
in major disalignment between company stakeholders and customers,
caused by wrong product being created and possibly delivered.
End results are waste of time and money; specifically, time to market lost
and money wasted on doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Apart from the intergroup issues outlined above there are ingroup problems
found in several teams.
Some were born from selective reading of the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles
inherent</a> to the agile manifesto.
Sentences like &quot;build projects around motivated individuals&quot;, &quot;continuous
attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility&quot; and &quot;the
best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing
teams&quot; have tricked peoples minds.
People naturally value their group more than outside people or groups and
fall into a cognitive bias where they see their group as better than other
groups.
That leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">reading known 
patterns</a> from unknown data,
taking the quotes above, from the agile manifesto principles it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">possible
to misread</a> that
&quot;teams own architecture, they must be made of motivated 
individuals and they must keep focus to technical excelence and good design&quot;
in order to achieve the agile panacea.
This ends in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis
paralysis</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good">overengineering</a>
and, lastly, moving in the direction not intended by the company itself.
This rogue line of action is how good groups get defiled from within.</p>
<p>Teams have a reduced vision of the world, that's the reason they're so
productive, they have a specific scope. Apple, Gitlab and others has been
known to battle overengineering and poor communication with techniques mainly
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/people-group/directly-responsible-individuals/">placing a single person 
responsible</a>
for a certain topic in order to guarantee delivery.
In sum this eliminates communication issues, since a single person is
responsible and accountable, and keeps focus on value delivered, since
there is no group decision thus no quorum required to get a final answer.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#delivery" id="delivery">Delivery</a></h2>
<p>Up until now we've covered issues from the understanding that value is the
one thing that matters, to issues with alignment, to challenges caused by
group behavior.
How hard is it to organize for consistent and quality delivery with a
large organization?
Do we need to copy spotify? Copy netflix? What?!</p>

It's a total representation of what agility aims to be, people focused on
delivering value with a feedback cycle on that delivery, decentralization
allowing people to be focused on goals instead of orders, teams finding
their own way for delivering value.</p>
<p>You don't need to copy spotify, netflix, nucor or anyone else, in fact
you should never copy blindly but learn by weighing pros and cons.
Remember that if you're doing deciding roadmap top-down then you're
using command-and-control and <a href="https://svpg.com/revenge-of-the-pmo/">you're doing
waterfall</a>.
Teams should have ideal size, be cross-functional and be completely
independent.
Not just engineers, product owners, managers, everyone required to deliver
value should be on a team.
Leadership should be good enough in order to decide goals so that teams can
dedicate time in finding the way to achieve them.
Product must be decided, designed, done and measured at the team level.
Finally, alignment is communication, not agreement.
Think mini-companies where each team is a company.</p>
<p>The glue?
<a href="https://youtu.be/PzEox3szeRc?t=1640">Short but strong guidelines</a> where
everyone can go and understand what are the contracts.
Finally, measuring value should not only be done at team level but also
passed bottom-up so that leadership can act in the case of mismatches,
in sum, pass information but give <strong>context</strong> as much as possible.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#context" id="context">Context</a></h2>
<p>In my self-reflection I had to bring up a lot of context which I tried to
summarize over the last handful of pages.
One of the key findings I did over these years is that software engineers
are on the best spot to <a href="https://twitter.com/backslashx1b/status/1299604272489934849">understand these
issues</a> with
ease, I'll risk and say that it's in fact natural!</p>
<p>Today, topics such as micro-services, distributed systems,
scaling stateless systems, application orchestrators, metrics and alarms
are quite common topics in producion environments.
All of these map to at least one of the issues which we see daily in
product engineering at scale.
Scaling problems are the same and software engineers are used to solve them.
There are known patterns, papers, blog posts, books, meetups and full-fledged
talks about these topics, software engineers must make use of all of this
tech material and start handling the scalability concerns in organizations
as they do in system design.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#value-for-engineers" id="value-for-engineers">Value for Engineers</a></h2>
<p>Some of us <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/">have read</a>,
praised and shared the notions of the SLI and SLO.
We all know how to do metrics and monitoring but not everyone measures
business metrics.
This is the core of SLIs, find a measure the is the best indicator of the
level your service is providing.
That's <strong>value</strong>.
The topic has been discussed some pages ago, this is the value that teams
need to create and that the customer wants or needs.
By measuring it, the team will be able to run in continuous mode, since
there's a gauge for the quality of delivery, and will be able as well
as provide a concise line of information to leadership reporting how the
team's work is doing.
Plus, by having an SLI, a team will never again be disconnected from the
value that it needs to deliver, overengineering and analysis paralysis
will begin to disapear.
In fact it's not much different from TDD either, walk towards a tangible,
well-defined, shared and understood goal.</p>
<p>Engineers know exactly how to do this, there is no reason to believe that
the notion of delivering value is hard to grasp.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#alignment-for-engineers" id="alignment-for-engineers">Alignment for Engineers</a></h2>
<p>Alignment concerns doing communication in a way that all desired groups or people get to a common understanding or in plain terms, everyone's looking at the same picture.</p>

CAP-Availability

Let’s talk briefly about the need to give up either linearizability or availability in the case of a network partition.

Let’s say you have replicas of your database in two different datacenters. The exact method of replication doesn’t matter for now – it may be single-leader (master/slave), multi-leader (master/master) or quorum-based replication (Dynamo-style). The requirement of replication is that whenever data is written in one datacenter, it also has to be written to the replica in the other datacenter. Assuming that clients only connect to one datacenter, there must be a network link between the two datacenters over which the replication happens.

<h1><a class="header" href="#technology-alignment" id="technology-alignment">Technology Alignment</a></h1>
<p>Instead of a proper tech radar I wrote this to state my bias openly.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments">D&amp;D alignments</a>
where the <em>lawful/chaotic</em> axis would evaluate the
restrictions while developing and the <em>good/bad</em> axis would evaluate the amount
of pain you get while operating that code.
These are orthogonal, any language, framework, system design or technique
will evaluate to specific value on both axes regarding the task at hand.</p>
<p>Orthogonal to these two axes I'll add a <em>logic</em> axis, in D&amp;D would be
whether someone is breaking role-play, which translates to cost-benefit
or the <em>I</em> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment">ROI</a>.
Overengineering is measured here, since we're talking about product engineering
and not plain engineering.
As corollary there are two sentences, the practical <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChaoticStupid">chaotic
stupid</a> is not an
alignment and the philosophical there is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/348436-there-is-nothing-so-useless-as-doing-efficiently-that-which">nothing so
useless</a>
as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.</p>
<p>I am biased towards <em>lawful good</em>, I prefer the lawful and the good ends of
the axes.
Furthermore, I consider the <em>logic</em> axis to be prohibitive below a
certain threshold.
If something is lower than a reasonable value on the logic axis then a
major issue is happening.</p>
<p>The rationale here is, when you're being paid to build something and you
imagine, dream of or make up requirements not originally there, then
you're costing the company both time to market and money, the worst part
is that these costs are hidden.
Never, ever, do this.
Ever.
If you believe some requirements should be there then talk to your peers
and double check that's true.
Don't <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit">disagree and commit</a>
on this, just raise awareness and, ultimately, leave.
Everyone in a group must be moving to the same target.
Always.
Maturity turns out to have a large slice of &quot;can you measure the I in ROI&quot;,
if it's not worth doing, don't do it, there is hardly anything as bad as
failing on this analysis.</p>
