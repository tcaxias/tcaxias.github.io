# Landing Pad

My name is Tiago Caxias. I am a computer scientist and I daily dwell in
product engineering.

I am passionate about computer science, programming languages, distributed
systems, systems design and the open source world.

My favorite area or work is getting people to understand the strong coupling
between UX, product delivery and everything written in the previous sentence.

In here you will find some texts written in
[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)
about topics I feel like spilling more words than twitter finds reasonable
and so that texts take less time to load and have less restrictions to
readers than linkedin or medium.

Heads up, I am [biased](./technology_alignment.md) towards simplicity,
efficiency and correctness.
